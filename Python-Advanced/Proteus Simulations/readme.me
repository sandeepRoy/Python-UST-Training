How to open the project and see the simulation?

- Extract using WinRAR
- Open the .pdsprj file using "Proteus"
- Proteus will open with Schematic & Source Code on seprate tabs
- Please make sure to import the HEX file for IR sensor
- In Schematic tab, There will be a 'Play' button at bottom left corner, on hitting that simulation will be initiated
- As per scenario the sim is executed, log file can be checked at the end

Thank You.
